## 🚀 Tech Stack & Core Technologies

- **Framework:** React 18+ powered by **Vite** for blazing-fast HMR and optimized production builds.
- **Language:** TypeScript for strict type safety and robust component contracts.

- **Routing:** React Router v6 supporting nested routes, dynamic parameters, and protected layouts.
- **Styling:** Custom modular CSS architecture with design tokens and responsive layouts.
